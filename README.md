Hi!

This Kaggle project uses the CSV-file called honeyproduction.csv file to build a Linear Regression model with scikit-learn. The goal is to predict, how honey production in the US might shrink in the future given how it did in the past.

You'll nee the following libraries for the project:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplot

The project code is explained inside the file with commentaries for you to understand  and rebuild.
